# React + Vite

This project (Mushroom) is a React application scaffolded with Vite. It provides a lightweight starter with common UI components, routing, and Supabase integration for backend data storage. The repo includes sample data in `src/data/` and reusable UI primitives in `src/components/ui/`.

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
